Introducing the testing interface, a visual way to efficiently test new features - also the class names don't suck.

# Using the testing interface

## TestCases

Each test is called a TestCase, a testcase is effectively an isolated environment to test practical uses of different classes. Use the bar on the left to navigate between the existing testcases.

## Navigating and modifying the UI
The buttons pane and the top bar are both seperate classes that are instantiated for each class that inherits from testcase. Customizing the buttons pane and/or top bar classes will affect all button panes and/or top bars.
